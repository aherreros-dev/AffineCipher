# AffineCipher
This repository contains two Python scripts for cryptographic analysis. The Affine Cipher Decoder decrypts messages using a known decimation constant, shift value, and alphabet, displaying or saving the output. The Letter Frequency Analyzer calculates letter occurrences and frequency in a `.txt` file.
